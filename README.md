# ------ NEAUBAE ---

The files are uploaded to www.neaubae.com , this is a domain I once bought. I will call my design&develop company like this, so this is my url for now. 

# ------ GOAL -------

The goal for this website is to showcase my HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4 skills. I did this by providing a nice, correct and 
complete website. The projects in the portfolio section, are real projects made by myself.

# ----- ABOUT ME ------

I have a Bachelor in Business IT and Management. During this program I did not learn any code, but I always wanted to learn more about the technical part (coding etc.). I consider myself to be creative and I have some experience with coding and creating websites in my free time. That means that I also had some experience with Bootstrap (I started using it when it was called Twitter Bootstrap). So I have some self-taught Bootstrap knowledge; thanks to this project, I learned how to use it more efficiently. 

# ----- TECHNOLOGY ------
During this project, I used HTML and CSS. Thanks to the Bootstrap Library, I was able to efficiently create a portfolio website. Bootstrap tools, such as using the href="#SECTIONID" for a menu item, make it easy to create a complete website. 

# ----- COLOR SCHEME ------

For this project I used the following color-scheme:
- black
- grey
- white

# ------ SOFTWARE ------

For this project, I am using the following software:
1. Sublime Text (HTML Editor, https://www.sublimetext.com/)
2. Sketch (Design Tool, https://www.sketch.com/)


# ------ DESIGN DIRECTORY ------

In this directory, I uploaded a .sketch file which contains the design for the website I wanted to create. This Sketch file was created by myself. During the assignment, I changed the design for the website a couple of times, which is why I uploaded different versions. The last version of the design is not 100% as the end-product. This is because I decided to take it on a different path.  


# ----- CREDITS -----

Thanks to the Code Institute for providing code challenges and enough material to try with. Thanks to Brian for our Skype session. We spoke each other just once, but I'm pretty sure I will need help during the JS and Python modules.
